Finding the minimum value in an unordered database is a common and fundamental task in computer science. However, the optimal classical deterministic algorithm can find the minimum value with a time complexity that grows linearly with the number of elements in the database. In this paper, we present the proposal of a quantum algorithm for finding the minimum value of a database, which is quadratically faster than its best classical analogs. We assume a Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) that stores values from a database and performs an iterative search based on an oracle whose role is to limit the searched values by controlling the states of the most significant qubits. A complexity analysis was performed in order to demonstrate the advantage of this quantum algorithm over its classical counterparts.

Keywords: Quantum RAM, Minimum search, Grover's Algorithm.
